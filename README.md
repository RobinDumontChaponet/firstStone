Base Transitive project I usually start with when I do a new web project.
It's really just some basic styles, scripts, presenters, misc. files, directory structure around a fresh install of Transitive-project.

Some of these files I am not the authors, these normally come with proper copyright/licence informations.


git clone
then 
composer update and/or install.
